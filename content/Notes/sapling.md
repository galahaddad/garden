A sapling is an article I've written that has gotten its atomic point across in my mind. It's reached the final conclusion I was targeting and can stand on its own. A sapling still needs tending to and may need to be reviewed to see if there are new links to be created with other articles, but for the most part has its base set of continuity between prior articles and the likely next article.
